Backbone Pagination
-------------------

Abstraction of backbonejs' collection to add  
pagination functionality  
  
** TO BE IMPLEMENTED **  
Will need MongoDB for demo usage.  
I like to use the command  
`nohup mongod --dbpath [path/to/data/db] > /dev/null 2>&1 &`  
to run mongod in the background. You can kill the process by  
bringing it into the foreground the linux jobs way or using  
kill with the job process ID
